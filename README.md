# Authentication System Practice â€“ 3-Level with Social Login

This repository contains practice implementations of a three-level authentication system, demonstrating:

- Basic login with email/password
- Role-based access (Admin, Moderator, User)
- Privilege control using sessions and cookies
- Google and Facebook login integration (OAuth)

This is for educational purposes to explore secure authentication techniques in modern web development.

> Note: This is not a complete project. It is a concept demo and still under development.
